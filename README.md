#Winter’18 Lightning Tree Component

#Using lightning:tree To Display Leads with Activity Information
Winter’18 Salesforce has added a new lightning component called lightning:tree, using this we can display the hierarchy of Salesforce. lightning: tree component provides visualization of a structure hierarchy. Tree items, also known as branches, 
can be expanded or collapsed.This component supports only version 41.0 and above.

#Business Use Case: We can use this component for displaying the Hierarchy structure like Account Hierarchy, Role Hierarchy, Custom Object Hierarchy. Also, we can use this component to display the information in hierarchy level like Leads with Activity Information, Top customers with Top Deals information.
Here I created a sample component to display my Leads with respective Tasks and on click on respective Task it will display the Task important information in modal like Subject, Status, Assigned To, Due Date and comments.
